## 🧠 Clean Architecture

FocusFlow follows a **feature-first Clean Architecture** approach, ensuring scalability, testability, and separation of concerns. The app is structured into three well-defined layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**

   - Contains UI widgets, pages, and Cubit-based state management.
   - Handles user interactions and reflects state changes.

2. **Domain Layer**

   - Encapsulates core business logic through **use cases**.
   - Defines abstract **repositories** and **entities**, independent of external dependencies.

3. **Data Layer**
   - Implements the repositories using **Firebase** as the data source.
   - Handles all communication with Firestore, Firebase Auth, and Firebase Storage.

### 🔧 Modular Feature Structure

Each major feature is self-contained under the `features/` directory in its own folder (`features/auth`, `features/workspace`, `features/board`, `features/task`), and follows the same internal structure.

- Simple download URL management.

### 🔁 Compared To:

| Alternative          | Firebase Edge |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Amazon S3        | More configurable and scalable for enterprise-scale apps, but requires additional effort to integrate with Firebase Auth and manage access rules |
| Supabase Storage        | Good for PostgreSQL integration but lacks the maturity and tooling Firebase offers for mobile-first development |

---

## 🚀 Implementation Plan:

- High-level overview of how database and storage are structured and connected to the app:
  
FocusFlow uses Firebase as the backend service to handle authentication, real-time data storage, and file management. The app is structured using a Clean Architecture approach, separating logic into Data, Domain, and Presentation layers.

- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication manages user sign-in/sign-up, and user data is stored in Cloud Firestore under the /users collection.
  
- **Firestore Database:** Structured into collections for users, workspaces, boards, and tasks. Each entity has its own subcollections and is linked via IDs for nested relationships (e.g., boards under a workspace, tasks under a board).
  
- **Firebase Storage:** Planned for future use to handle file uploads like attachments, avatars, and profile pictures.
  
- **Data Layer:** Implements repository interfaces using Firebase as the source of truth. It handles all reads/writes from Firestore and Storage.
  
- **Presentation Layer:** Uses Cubit (Bloc) for reactive state management. UI reacts to Firebase data changes via streams or real-time listeners.
  
This setup allows modular, scalable interaction between the app and Firebase services, ensuring seamless real-time collaboration and secure data handling.

# Technical Questions

## 1. Backend Architecture: Scaling to Support 1 Million Workspaces

To support scalability as the user base and number of workspaces grow to 1 million or more, the backend should be designed with **scalability**, **resilience**, and **modularity** in mind. The following architectural strategies are recommended:


### 🧱 Microservices Architecture

Decompose the monolithic application into independent, loosely coupled services — such as:

- `AuthService`
- `WorkspaceService`
- `BoardService`
- `TaskService`

**Benefits:**

- Independent deployment and scaling of services  
- Better fault isolation and maintainability  
- Language and technology flexibility across services  


### 🧩 Database Sharding

Implement **horizontal partitioning (sharding)** of the database based on `user ID` or `workspace ID`.

**Benefits:**

- Distributes workload across multiple databa instances  
- Reduces query latency under high load  
- Prevents performance bottlenecks in single-node architectures  


### ⚡ Caching Layer

Incorporate a high-performance caching solutions as **Redis** to:

- Reduce database reads for frequently accessed data (e.g., workspace metadata, task summaries)  
- Improve latency and throughput of read-heavy operations  


### 🔁 Asynchronous Processing

Use message brokers like **RabbitMQ** or **Apache Kafka** to handle non-blocking, long-running tasks such as:

- Email notifications  
- Activity logging  

This decouples the user experience from backend processing and improves responsiveness.


### 🌐 API Gateway

Leverage an API Gateway (e.g., **AWS API Gateway**, **NGINX**) to:

- Route and load balance traffic across microservices  
- Enforce security policies (authentication, authorization)  
- Implement rate limiting, logging, and request transformation

---
## 2. Authentication Strategy: Securing Authentication Across Mobile and Web Applications and Handling token expiration and refresh flows

A robust authentication strategy is critical to ensuring secure access across mobile and web platforms. The implementation should combine industry standards with secure storage and proper token management. The following components form a comprehensive approach:

---

### 🔐 Authentication Protocols

Leverage modern authentication protocols such as:

- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect**  
  For federated login using identity providers like Google, Apple, or traditional email/password authentication.

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**  
  Used for stateless authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), where tokens encode user roles, permissions, and metadata.

---

### 🔑 Token Types and Secure Storage

Implement a dual-token system to balance usability and security:

- **Access Token** (short-lived):  
  Valid for ~15 minutes to minimize exposure risk.

- **Refresh Token** (long-lived):  
  Valid for 7–30 days depending on security requirements.

**Secure Token Storage:**

- **Mobile:**
  - *iOS:* Store tokens in the **Keychain**
  - *Android:* Use **EncryptedSharedPreferences** or **Android Keystore**

- **Web:**
  - Use **HttpOnly**, **Secure Cookies** to prevent XSS attacks  
  - Avoid using `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` for sensitive tokens

---

### 🔄 Token Expiration and Refresh Flows

Ensure a seamless user experience while maintaining security.

1. **Token Lifecycle**
   - The access token is included in each API request.
   - When it expires, the client silently uses the refresh token to obtain a new access token.

2. **Refresh Flow Handling**
   - On receiving a `401 Unauthorized` response, a refresh token request is triggered.
   - On success, replace the old tokens and retry the original request.

3. **Failure Handling**
   - If the refresh token is invalid or expired (e.g., revoked, tampered):
     - Clear stored credentials
     - Force user logout
     - Redirect to the login screen

This mechanism ensures continued secure access without frequent interruptions while guarding against unauthorized access through compromised tokens.
